# Cloud Security Best Practices with AWS IAM
Ensuring robust security in the cloud is essential for managing resources efficiently and protecting sensitive data. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) offers a powerful way to implement fine-grained access control for your cloud environment. I explored the vital role of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) in ensuring secure and controlled access to cloud resources. Using a hands-on project, I demonstrated how to configure IAM policies, create user groups, and assign permissions to EC2 instances.

This README summarizes the key steps from the [full article: Cloud Security Best Practices with AWS IAM](https://medon.hashnode.dev/cloud-security-best-practices-with-aws-iam), authored by Ahmed Salau.

## Introduction
AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that helps you securely manage access to AWS resources. It enables you to create and manage AWS users and groups and define their permissions through policies. IAM helps ensure that only authorized users and services have access to the resources they need, and it offers fine-grained control over who can access specific resources. With IAM, you can implement the principle of least privilege, allowing users to perform only necessary actions, increasing security and reducing the risk of accidental misconfigurations.

**Prerequisite**

1. **Have an AWS account**. If you don‚Äôt have one, sign up here [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) and enjoy the benefits of the [Free-Tier Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

## üìù Step-by-Step Guide
Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to the project:

1. **Set up EC2 Instances**:
   - Launch two EC2 instances‚Äîone for the production environment and one for development.
   - Tag the instances with "Env = production" and "Env = development".

2. **Create IAM Policies**:
   - Write a policy that allows delete access to only the development instance.
   - Attach the policy to an IAM group.

3. **Create IAM Users and Groups**:
   - Create a group for your intern with permissions to access only the development EC2 instance.
   - Add the intern as a user and assign them to the group.

4. **Test Access**:
   - Log in using the intern‚Äôs credentials and test their access to both instances to ensure the permissions are correctly set.

5. **Clean Up Resources**:
   - After testing, delete the EC2 instances, user, and group to avoid any ongoing charges.


## üéâ Conclusion 
In conclusion, this project has provided hands-on experience with essential AWS concepts, such as EC2 instances, IAM users, policies, and access control. By using tags to manage resources and setting permissions through IAM, I created a secure and organized cloud environment. Additionally, learning to manage users and resources properly ensures both functionality and cost control. Lastly, always remember to clean up unused resources to avoid unnecessary charges, and maintain security practices when working in the AWS cloud environment.
